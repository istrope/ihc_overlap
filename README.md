Currenlty I have a few working answers to the overlap problem for cox6c and tpi1:
1. colocalization percentage, where its normalized by imaging session number
2. high thresholding based upon positive control to filter out noise
3. negative control threshold, positive control signal normalization, cell counting normalization of signal,

Utility scripts:
1. plot channels: cox6x, tpi1, dapi and their overlap
2. plot colocalization metrics as boxplots
3. find cell counts using cellpose
